# Nucleo_L476RG_XBLE1_SampleApp_v1
two STM32 Nucleo boards with their STM32 expansion boards                                                                                                       respective BlueNRG-MS are needed.
One board needs to be configured as Server-Peripheral role, while the                                                                                                other needs to be configured as Client-Central role. 

Keeping either defined or undefined the #define SERVER_ROLE, in file app_bluenrg_ms.c, 
the target can be respectively configured either as SERVER or as CLIENT.                                                                                                          - Program the CLIENT on one STM32 Nucleo board, with BlueNRG-MS STM32 expansion board,                                                                                         and reset it.                                                                                                                                                              - Program the SERVER on a second STM32 Nucleo board, with BlueNRG-MS STM32 expansion                                                                                           board, and reset it.                                                                                                                                                       - After establishing the connection between the two boards (when the LED2 on the                                                                                               CLIENT turns off),                                                                                                                                                           by pressing the USER button on one board, the LD2 LED on the other one gets toggled                                                                                          and viceversa.
